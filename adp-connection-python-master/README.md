## ADP Marketplace Partners

There are a few pre-requesites that you need to fullfill in order to use this library:
- Replace the certifcates in this library with the ones you recieved from the [CSR Tool](https://apps.adp.com/apps/165104)
- Update the client id and client secret with the ones supplied in your credentials document PDF
- Update endpoints from ```https://iat-api.adp.com``` and ```https://iat-accounts.adp.com``` to  ```https://api.adp.com``` and ```https://accounts.adp.com```.

# ADP Client Connection Library for Python

The ADP Client Connection Library is intended to simplify and aid the process of authenticating, authorizing and connecting to the ADP Marketplace API Gateway. The Library includes a sample application that can be run out-of-the-box to connect to the ADP Marketplace API **test** gateway.

There are two ways of installing and using this library:

  - Clone the repo from Github: This allows you to access the raw source code of the library as well as provides the ability to run the sample application and view the Library documentation
  - Install from PyPI: When you are ready to use the library in your own application use this method to install it using pip

### Version
1.0.1

### Installation

**Clone from Github**

You can either use the links on Github or the command line git instructions below to clone the repo.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/adplabs/adp-connection-python.git adp-connection-python
```

followed by

```sh
$ cd adp-connection-python
$ make setup
$ make docs
```

The make setup will also install the **requests** package along with a few other developer dependencies. The make docs will generate the docs and open up a browser displaying the main docs page. If you run into errors you may need to run the setup using sudo.

```sh
$ sudo make setup
$ make docs
```

*Run the sample app*

```sh
$ cd adp_connection/democlient
$ python -u sampleApp.py
```

This starts an HTTP server on port 8889 (this port must be unused to run the sample application). You can point your browser to http://localhost:8889. The sample app allows you to connect to the ADP test API Gateway using the **client_credentials** and **authorization_code** grant types. For the **authorization_code** connection, you will be asked to provide an ADP username (MKPLDEMO) and password (marketplace1).

***

**Install from PyPI**

Make sure you have **pip** installed. Then use the following commad to install the library.

```sh
$ pip install adp_connection
```

If you run into errors, you may need to install using sudo.

```sh
$ sudo pip install adp_connection
```

You should now be able to import adp_connection in your own applications.

## Examples
### Create Client Credentials ADP Connection

```python
import sys
from os import curdir, sep
from adp_connection.lib import *

config = dict({})
config['clientID'] = '88a73992-07f2-4714-ab4b-de782acd9c4d'
config['clientSecret'] = 'a130adb7-aa51-49ac-9d02-0d4036b63541'
config['sslCertPath'] = 'certs/cert.pem'
config['sslKeyPath'] = 'certs/cert.key'
config['tokenServerURL'] = 'https://iat-api.adp.com/auth/oauth/v2/token'
config['disconnectURL'] = 'https://iat-accounts.adp.com/auth/oauth/v2/logout'
config['apiRequestURL'] = 'https://iat-api.adp.com'
config['grantType'] = 'client_credentials'

# Initialize the Connection Configuration Object.
# Since the grant type is client_credentials a
# ClientCredentialsConfiguration object is returned
try:
    ClientCredentialsConfiguration = ConnectionConfiguration().init(config)

    # Using the new configuration object create a connection
    ccConnection = ADPAPIConnectionFactory().createConnection(ClientCredentialsConfiguration)

    resp = ''

    # try to connect and send the response back
    ccConnection.connect()
    if (ccConnection.isConnectedIndicator()):

        # A successful connection generates a UUID as a session identifier
        # which can be retrieved using the getSessionState() method call on
        # the connection. There is also provision to set a user-defined
        # session identifier using the setSessionState(string) method call on
        # the connection. This should be done after a connection has been
        # obtained from the connection factory, but before calling connect()
        #
        # We can use the session identifier as a key to store the connection
        # into the global connection dictionary for later retrieval on
        # subsequent requests
        self.connectionDict[ccConnection.getSessionState()] = ccConnection
        print 'Connected!'
        print 'access token: ' + ccConnection.getAccessToken()
        print 'expiration: ' + ccConnection.getExpiration().strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
        print 'session state:' + ccConnection.getSessionState()
    else:
        resp = '<b>Not Connected!</b>'
except ConfigError as conferr:

except ConnectError as connecterr:
    print connecterr.code + ': ' + connecterr.msg
except:

```

### Create Authorization Code ADP Connection

```python
